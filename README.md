# Note-Taking Application
This is the Fall 2024 Final Project submission for Group 2 (Anwyn MacIntosh, Morgan Nogradi, and Emily Owens) for CIS 285 Object-Oriented Programming.

It is a note-taking application, allowing the user to create, save, delete, clear, edit, tag, and search their own notes.
